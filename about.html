								<p>Humble Beginnings</p>
								<h2>Our Founder: ALfredo Linguini</h2>
							</header>
							<p> ALfredo Linguini began his mission to conquer Italy in an early age. He was born in the Italian country side, under an olive tree.
							 Legend has it that his parents were cheese nomads and had to birth him on wheel of parmessan as his mom started labor a month early.  </p>

							<p>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang, and although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.</p>
