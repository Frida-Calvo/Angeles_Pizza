  <p>If you're reading this, it's because I didn't get to finish my website yet.
  Most of my time was spent looking for a good theme, and then a good
  background. Figuring out how to get a picture to not look pixelated
  and making it look nice.</p>

  <p>The future of the website will be this:
  Have lots of buttons, so that when you click them, a fact about me pops up.
  Have pictures that I have taken and edited, it took way too long to figure out
  how to add the Frida Kahlo picture on the "Photography" tab. That's the only image
  I have so far. More to come!</p>

  <p>I'll add a resume (I'll just make it on the spot)</p>

  <p>I wanted to add some Japanese text, but I never got to that. :0</p>

  <p>And info about Mexico, like all the artisan art and food!</p>

<p>
Hi! I'm a high school junior who's currently doing the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program.
I've been doing photography with First Exposures for a year now, starting with digital but soon transfering to analog photography.
I was named after Frida Kahlo by my dad, who thought my last name, "Calvo" sounded a lot like "Kahlo" while visiting The Blue House.
I live with my mom, my dad, and my little brother in the beautiful city of San Francisco. When I'm not wandering around the city with my camera,
you can find me hanging out with my family and friends or learning new things.
